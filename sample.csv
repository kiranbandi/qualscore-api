5d23b258597f0811be566fd7,"User provided appropriate, safe disposition instructions to his patients today. The instructions were straight forward and easily understood.
Appropriately ordered imaging studies prior to review with staff, particularly with a time sensitive concern regarding possible testicular torsion.
Although this is not the appropriate EPA to document this - teaching points today included: working on common ER meds and dosages, especially antibiotics, review EBV/mono and disposition instructions as well as review angioedema - causes and treatment."
5d23b258597f0811be566fd8,"User consulted radiology for multiple imaging tests on patients as well as a gyne consult on a patient 
1) His radiology imaging requests were well done (succinct) and he collaborated well with the radiologist to decide most appropriate imaging for his patients (U/S versus CT in a post-op gyne patient) and CT versus CTA for elderly patient with abdominal pain and known AAA"

5d23b258597f0811be566fda,"Good documentation, thorough use of medical record to complete patient history ie. patient with leg wound after vascular surgery. 
It seemed like during this shift, you used your time to write notes as time to organize your thoughts, which slowed you down by interrupting your task flow ie. not writing orders immediately after seeing a patient."

Good plan for the injury as well as variations based on possible x-ray findings with the exception of management of patellar dislocation (which this wasn't).
